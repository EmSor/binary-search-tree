# binary-search-tree

The main.cpp program reads the .txt file named bitacoraOrdenada and saves the ip adresses (without their access ports) into a BST where the key is the number of times that a specific ip has been accessed and the value is the ip itself. In addition the main.cpp will print the top 5 most accessed ips (this can be modified to show the top x most accessed ips).
